            "content": "What is a Random Value? . &quot;Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring&quot; . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . What are Examples of Random outputs in the world? Add a few you can think of Ex: Marbles . import random random_number = random.randint(1,100) print(random_number) . 33 . def randomlist(): list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;blueberry&quot;] element = random.choice(list) print(element) randomlist() . banana . Real Life Examples: Dice Roll . import random for i in range(3): roll = random.randint(1,6) print(&quot;Roll &quot; + str(i + 1) + &quot;:&quot; + str(roll)) . Roll 1:4 Roll 2:4 Roll 3:4 . Challenge #1 . Write a function that will a simulate a coinflip and print the output . def coinflip(): #Write your code here . EXTRA: Create a function that will randomly select 5 playing Cards and check if the 5 cards are a Royal Flush . Homework . Given a random decimal number convert it into binary as Extra convert it to hexidecimal as well. .",
